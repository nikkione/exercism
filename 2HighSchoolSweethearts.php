/*
 * Strings
Strings are a series of characters, surrounded by quotes. Both single and double quotes are supported.

<?php

$where = "Spain";
$what = 'rain';
String variable expansion
In double quoted strings, if a variable is referenced while it is in scope, the value is inserted into the string.

<?php

$answer = 42;
$expanded = "The answer to life, the universe, and everything is $answer";
Character Encoding Support
Historically, string functions in PHP only supported ASCII characters and did not support modern Unicode encodings. ASCII characters are each 1 byte, whereas Unicode characters may be 1-4 bytes in length. If needing to manipulate Unicode strings safely, refer to the multibyte versions of the historic functions.

<?php

$byte_length = strlen('ðŸ˜ƒ'); // => 4
$string_length = mb_strlen('ðŸ˜ƒ'); // => 1
Instructions
In this exercise, you are going to help high school sweethearts profess their love on social media by generating an ASCII heart with their initials:

     ******       ******
   **      **   **      **
 **         ** **         **
**            *            **
**                         **
**     J. K.  +  M. B.     **
 **                       **
   **                   **
     **               **
       **           **
         **       **
           **   **
             ***
              *
1. Get the name's first letter
Implement the HighSchoolSweetheart::firstLetter function. It should take a name and return its first letter. It should clean up any unnecessary whitespace from the name.

<?php

$sweetheart = new HighSchoolSweetheart();
$sweetheart->firstLetter("Jane");
# => "J"
2. Format the first letter as an initial
Implement the HighSchoolSweetheart::initial function. It should take a name and return its first letter, uppercase, followed by a dot. Make sure to reuse HighSchoolSweetheart::first_letter that you defined in the previous step.

<?php

$sweetheart = new HighSchoolSweetheart();
$sweetheart->initial("jane");
# => "J."
3. Split the full name into the first name and the last name
Implement the HighSchoolSweetheart::initials function. It should take a full name, consisting of a first name and a last name separated by a space, and return the initials. Make sure to reuse HighSchoolSweetheart::initial that you defined in the previous step.

<?php

$sweetheart = new HighSchoolSweetheart();
$sweetheart->initials("Jane Doe");
# => "J. D."
4. Put the initials inside of the heart
Implement the HighSchoolSweetheart::pair function. It should take two full names and return the initials inside an ASCII heart. Make sure to reuse HighSchoolSweetheart::initials that you defined in the previous step.

<?php

$sweetheart = new HighSchoolSweetheart();
$sweetheart->pair("Blake Miller", "Riley Lewis")
# => """
#      ******       ******
#    **      **   **      **
#  **         ** **         **
# **            *            **
# **                         **
# **     B. M.  +  R. L.     **
#  **                       **
#    **                   **
#      **               **
#        **           **
#          **       **
#            **   **
#              ***
#               *
# """
